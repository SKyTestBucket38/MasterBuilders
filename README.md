Welcome to Build Battle. Please read the important tab before using this plugin

# Important

* Please read the Plugin Works tab to see how plugin works

# Plugin Works

Currently, the plugin is designed for 5 players (ie on the server must have only 5 slots). When a player join to the server, he immediately joined the queue at the entrance to BuildBattle.

What would make a few arenas, you must make example 2 server (5 slots each), plus one server (the lobby where he will be moved to the server minigame).

It turns out you need to move the plugin on the servers.

## Coming Soon 

* More Slots for players to join - beta2

* JoinSign- beta3

* More themes and topics - beta2
